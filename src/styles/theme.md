# Themes

The theme allows you to specify the color of general components, darkness of surfaces, wheter the base color of the site should be dark or light etc.

The base theme applies a general tone to the application and allows customization to all design aspects.

Lets have a look at the basic theme object to understand how a theme is assembled. Changes to the theme configuration variables in the object below is the most effective way to match Material-UI to your needs.

```json
{
  "breakpoints": Object,
  "direction": String,
  "mixins": Object,
  "overrides": Object,
  "palette": Object,
  "props": Object,
  "shadows": Array,
  "typography": Object,
  "spacing": Function,
  "shape": Object,
  "transitions": Object,
  "zIndex": Object
}
```

## How to change color scheme

In order to set or customize a theme, the `ThemeProvider` component needs to be used. This is however optional as Material-UI components comes with a default theme.

As the `ThemeProvider` passes down state using the context feature in React, we can set the base theme in the project by wrapping the `ThemeProvider` outside of the encapsulated `App` component inside our `index.tsx` file.

The `ThemeProvider` sets the theme based on our desired `theme` object by passing it into the `theme` prop of the component.

Lets have a look at how to set a theme for our general application.

```javascript
ReactDOM.render(
  <React.StrictMode>
    <ThemeProvider theme={theme}>
      // Themprovider wrapped outside of App component
      <CssBaseline />
      <App />
    </ThemeProvider>
  </React.StrictMode>,
  document.getElementById("root")
);
```

## How to change color palette

The `Palette` object is one of the important variables to configure, as it enables you to modify the color of components to suit your needs. In the example below, the blue primary color set within the palette object represents the primary interface for the user. Blue in this case will be the color displayed most frequently across the screens and components of the application.

```javascript
import { createMuiTheme } from "@material-ui/core/styles";
import blue from "@material-ui/core/colors/blue";

const theme = createMuiTheme({
  palette: {
    primary: blue,
  },
});
```

## How to change spacings

Spacing is set and configured to create a consistent spacing between the different elements.

Material UI uses a recommended 8px scaling factor by default.

```javascript
const theme = createMuiTheme();

theme.spacing(2); // = 8 * 2
```

Custom spacing can also be used and set accordingly:

```javascript
const theme = createMuiTheme({
  spacing: 4,
});

theme.spacing(2); // = 4 * 2
```

## How to have multiple themes

Mutiple themes can be generated by creating a new instance of `createMuiTheme({})` .

```javascript
// A custom theme for this app
export const baseTheme = createMuiTheme({
  palette: {
    primary: {
      main: purple[500],
    },
    secondary: {
      main: green[500],
    },
  },
});

export const innerTheme = createMuiTheme({
  palette: {
    primary: {
      main: yellow[500],
    },
    secondary: {
      main: black[500],
    },
  },
});
```

To apply the themes in the example above, we use the `ThemeProvider` component and pass our `theme` objects in the `theme` prop of the components.

```javascript
<ThemeProvider theme={baseTheme}>
  <Checkbox defaultChecked />
  <ThemeProvider theme={innerTheme}>
    <Checkbox defaultChecked />
  </ThemeProvider>
</ThemeProvider>
```

In the example above, the innerTheme will override the baseTheme.
